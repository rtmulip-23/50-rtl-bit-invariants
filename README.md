# 50-rtl-bit-invariants
This repository contains a curated set of 50 RTL problems focused on bit-level reasoning and invariant-based hardware thinking.  The goal is not to practice syntax, FSMs, or HDL features, but to develop the ability to recognize and reuse fundamental logic invariants that repeatedly appear in real digital design.
